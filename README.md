# a simple pong game made with python and Tkinter

We used tkinter to create ui, because idk if running pong on console would be very convenient, let alone possible. 

If you have any suggestions, please create a pull request and i will review it! ...eventually

Play pong until you get bored and go to smth else

I hope you like it, u think its pretty cool!
